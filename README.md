FastFood Guru
The Idea: Yelp is a pretty popular source of restaurant reviews. However, most people use it to learn about restaurants they have never heard about before. What about massive fast-food chains like McDonald’s and Burger King? Plenty of people go to these, but somehow, they are not a popular review candidate.

Yes, you might tell me that every menu is pretty much the same, and the food always tastes the same as well. However, if you visited many of these chain “restaurants”, you know there are a few things that differ wildly.

Which one has the most luxurious bathroom? Which ones mark up their menu prices? Which ones have funny drunks at 1AM in the morning? This would be a review site for those fast-food chains that are supposedly consistent.

Type of Site: Reviews

Key Functions:

Ability to create an account with a picture, username and location
Use Google Maps to let a user pick out a specific restaurant, either through searching a location on the map or through typing in a name and choosing from a list (typeahead)
Allow the user to write a review
Allow user to rate the following fast-food specific topics on 1–5 scale: Bathroom Quality, Staff, Cleanliness, Drive-thru Sassy Level, Delivery Speed
Ability to add pictures to the review
Responsive design down to mobile
Key Feature Decisions:

Is this a serious website, or is it really about the funny things that can happen at a fast-food joint?
Who will be using this site? People on roadtrips trying to choose a lunch place? Frequent fast-food visitors looking to share their experience?
Should this be a community where people frequently check the site for funny stories and participate? Or more one-time, infrequent use?
What social media integration might help spread stories/reviews?
What You Will Learn: User systems and picture storage are two major challenges. This will be a good chance to implement a basic version of each. Also, if you choose to make this a humor-oriented site, how can your design influence an appropriate level of humor that is not nasty? If you want to gain a following, this will be a good test to see where you might be able to source current fast food reviews to seed your database and create immediate content.
